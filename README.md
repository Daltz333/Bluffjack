# Bluffjack
A multiplayer blackjack game based on Resident Evil 7's 21.

## Summary
A not so typical game of Blackjack, called Bluffjack. There is only one of each number in the deck,  
and you and your opponent share the same deck. This isn't all... There are a few "special" cards in the deck.  
These cards can be played during your turn and do not count as "playing" a card. These "trumps"  
can modify the winning score to be 21, 17, 24. Nullify a loss, gain the highest card in the deck, etc.

## Background
All credit for the original concept and idea goes to the developers of Resident Evil 7. I take absolutely **no**  
credit for the idea. I do however take credit for any artwork, code, css, etc. If you steal my stuff... I **will**  
find you ðŸ˜‰. This project was originally created for my Advanced Java Concepts class, but I wanted to challenge  
myself a little bit. 

## Issues/Pull Requests
Unless it's an *actual* bug, please do **NOT** submit a bug report.
