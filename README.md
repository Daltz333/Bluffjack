# Bluffjack
A multiplayer blackjack game based on Resident Evil 7's 21.

<hr/>

## Summary
A not so typical game of Blackjack, called Bluffjack. There is only one of each number in the deck,  
and you and your opponent share the same deck. This isn't all... There are a few "special" cards in the deck.  
These cards can be played during your turn and do not count as "playing" a card. These "trumps"  
can modify the winning score to be 21, 17, 24. Nullify a loss, gain the highest card in the deck, etc.

#### Round Based System
This blackjack game has a sort of RPG life system. Players have a health of 10 points. Losing a game can make  
make you lose a point. Trump Cards can be used to influence how many points are lost when you lose a match.

#### "Trump" Cards
Trump Cards are special cards that are randomly given to the player at the beginning of each match.  
These cards can be kept between matches, until the game is over. Trump Cards can influence many aspects  
of the game, such as changing the required score to win, changing the number of points "raising the stakes" lost  
when losing a match. You get exactly one card at the beginning of each round. Multiple trumps can be used at once  
and they do not count as "drawing" a card.

## Background
All credit for the original concept and idea goes to the developers of Resident Evil 7. I take absolutely **no**  
credit for the idea. I do however take credit for any artwork, code, css, etc. If you steal my stuff... I **will**  
find you ðŸ˜‰. This project was originally created for my Advanced Java Concepts class, but I wanted to challenge  
myself a little bit.
